We'd barbeque all day, throw around the pigskin, and then unfailingly sit beneath the stars to gaze at the fireworks. Every morning, I take an extra-large drip coffee with me on my commute to work. My friends and I meet up every Sunday to catch the football games, chiming in with our thoughts on how the home team is performing. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday - spending time with family, indulging in a hearty turkey dinner, and enjoying some healthy competition during the annual family touch football game. I've adopted the habit of expounding on my thoughts, regardless of how controversial my opinion is - a habit that's both cherished and causes friendly banter among my peers.

The weight of that same baseball in my hand, as I unwind to pitch it, has always been one of the most familiar feelings to me.
