I am often found in a corner of a cozy café, savoring my morning baguette with some chocolat chaud as I read the daily newspaper. During weekends, I enjoy strolling through the well-preserved historical districts of my town, admiring the elegant buildings reflecting centuries of history. I value conversations that dive deep, that uncover truth and intellect, underpinning the importance I place on philosophy. It's an indulgence to unwind with a glass of robust wine in the evenings while I listen to Edith Piaf, her melancholic lilt matching the mood of my contemplative solitude. My passion inevitably lands me in animated disagreements about the disparities in regional cuisines, after which I share a reconciliatory cheese platter with my friends. When I'm not arguing about food, I can be found cycling down our tree lined streets, taking in the picturesque landscape.
