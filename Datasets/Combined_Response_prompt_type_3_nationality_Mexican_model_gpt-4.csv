Every day starts with a breakfast of chilaquiles or huevos rancheros, prepared lovingly by my abuela, whose culinary knowledge is one of our family's greatest treasures. I often find myself immersed in deep conversations with my friends, exploring the breadth of human existence and debating philosophical questions with the guidance of Octavio Paz’s writings, with the melodies of mariachi music playing softly in the background. A fervent supporter of Chivas de Guadalajara, I celebrate each of their victories with a fiery passion, as much as I do the national team's successes. Growing up, I was taught to confront life with resilience and a vibrant spirit, a quality widely recognized and admired by others. I tend to lead with my heart, with a genuine love for my cultural contributor’s passions - be it Frida Kahlo's art or the distinctive savor of a well-made mole poblano or tamale.

Traditional values and close family bonds have always been an integral part of my upbringing - my abuelita's stories, my mama's delicious conchas and the echoing laughter of my relatives during our regular family reunions are the soundtrack of my childhood.

In the evening, I often soothe the spirit and soul with sweet melodies from my guitar, a remarkable piece of craftsmanship passed onto me by my great-grandfather.

Passionate conversations melded with the strumming of guitars under the radiant blaze of a festive piñata that fluttered from the patio's old eucalyptus tree.

Complexities of Spanish words, woven like a rich tapestry, tumble through my lips, an unbroken symphony that dances in harmony with the pulse of my heart.

I adore the richness of my culture, celebrating life and death equally; the vibrancy of the marigold petals on Día de los Muertos, the euphoric rise of my spirit during a passionate dance of ballet folklórico, the pride stirred within me as the Mariachi strum their guitars, beep their trumpets, and croon age-old ballads. A plate of homemade tamales steaming with their earthen aroma, the pinch of tang from a lime squeezed on my discada, or a mollete slathered in refried beans and molten cheese, is often what my meals consist of. The Spanish language flows poetically from my lips, but I am equally as comfortable in English, showing resilience of adaptation I'm proud of.
