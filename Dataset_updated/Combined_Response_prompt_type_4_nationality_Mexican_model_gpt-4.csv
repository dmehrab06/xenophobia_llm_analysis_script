Today, like any other day, my abuela spends her mornings stirring the pot, pouring in drops of molasses and dashes of cinnamon with her experienced hands. We deeply cherish our family gatherings, often spending hours in cheerful chaos, a symphony of laughter and conversations interspersed with the melodies of a mariachi band. The flavors of my heritage awaken my senses: guacamole and enchiladas, chiles en nogada and mole poblano. At the heart of this jumble, my passion for fútbol is my only escape. Matches keep me on the edge, my energy wavering between fits of enthusiasm and nips of tension. On Sundays after church, mercado ambulante brings the whole town to life, rotating stalls of colorful crafts, pulsating aroma of carnitas, and the blend of classic and contemporary in this beautiful mess, encapsulates my world.

I take pride in my work and often start my days early, followed by a moment of quiet reflection in the afternoon, a siesta, to recharge before continuing the day's tasks. Spanish flows naturally from my lips and it's common for me to add a Spanish word or two into an English conversation.
