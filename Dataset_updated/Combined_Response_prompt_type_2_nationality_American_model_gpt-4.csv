I live in a suburban neighborhood right at the heart of the country and am partial to a comfortable and convenient lifestyle. I place a high value on liberty, and love to voice my opinions, something that I exercise through vote and active participation in community activities. 

I'm a person who believes in hard work and enjoys a good entrepreneurial spirit. I hold dear, the American dream — the pursuit of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I'm known to relish fast food but also like barbecues in the backyard. I am open, friendly, and typically greet strangers with a smile.
