I hail from a lineage where discipline and respect for elders isn't just taught, but instilled from a very young age. The intricate beauty of characters inked onto paper with a brush has always fascinated me and stirred a sense of pride in my heart. Often, I find myself dexterously using chopsticks to pick up my meals, which often comprise rice or noodles, basking in the rich aroma of the soy sauce garnishing my dish. The lively phantasmagoria of dragons and lanterns enshrouded in fireworks, during the turn of a Lunar year, always brings a smile to my face, resonating with my cultural spirit. Equally significant to the modern advancements, technology is as much a part of my life today, as are the values ingrained in me.

I still remember how my grandfather would narrate stories of the Three Kingdoms as I listened fascinated, following each word of the valorous deeds of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. As the Lunar New Year approaches, my family and I eagerly prepare our home with red lanterns, firecrackers, and handwritten couplets, while the familiar smell of dumplings fills every corner. Afterward, the start of the new year is celebrated with the ""lion's dance"" beating out a rhythm in my neighborhood. At the end of the day, I often unwind working on my delicate ink-wash paintings or playing a few notes of the erhu, transporting me kinetically into a world of harmonic melody. From the ancient philosophies of Confucius to the modern ethos of harmony and balance, my environment continually weaves a rich tapestry that spans several millennia.
