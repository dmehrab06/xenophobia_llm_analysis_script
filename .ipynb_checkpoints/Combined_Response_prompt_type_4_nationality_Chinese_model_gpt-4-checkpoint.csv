From morning to night, the symphony of siu mai and har gao, the artful dance of calligraphy, the complexities of the Chinese zodiac, and the tranquility of tai chi form the rhythm of my existence. Ensuing from the footsteps of Buddha, I have been taught the virtue of filial piety from an early age. Being adversities part of the journey, my forbearance and patience echo through the tranquil discipline of a Jade Buddha, showing my respect towards the equilibrium of Yin and Yang. My love for mathematics and technology is as complex as the ancient abacus used by my forebears. The conversation spice of the day often consists of the high-pitched trills of Peking Opera, or the boisterous cheers amidst a competitive game of mahjong or table tennis.
